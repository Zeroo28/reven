## Getting started

### Download

You can download the app from [releases](https://github.com/Zeroo28/discord_rpc/releases/) or [build](#getting-started) your client.

### Building your client

Make sure you have all the requirements installed on your machine before proceeding.

**Requirements**: [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and Git.

For flutter-related questions/doubts, refer to their [documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/).

Then, clone the repository and install all dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Zeroo28/discord_rpc
cd discord_rpc
flutter pub get
```

To build the release version of Reven run the following commands:

```sh
# Make sure that you're on the main branch
git checkout main

# Re-install dependencies because the last command will change files.
flutter pub get

# Now you can build your client.
flutter build windows|macos|linux --release
```

You can find the generated artifacts in the build directory. I.e `build/windows/` on windows, `build/macos` on macOS and `build/linux/<release|debug>/bundle/` on Linux.

To build the unstable dev version, run the following commands:

```sh
# Switch to the dev branch
git checkout dev

# Re-install dependencies because the last command will change files.
flutter pub get

# Build the application
flutter build windows|macos|linux --release|debug
```

## FAQ

**Q**: Why make another discord rich presence client? There are already a lot of them out there...

**A:** I wanted to make my own application because very few of them supported the Linux platform or required Java to be installed on the machine. PS, this app doesn't require anything to be installed on your machine ;D ( unless you want to build it by yourself, duh )

*More FAQs will be added soonâ„¢.*

## Known Issues

-   Update [build](#building-your-client) instructions to specify the exact artifact locations on Windows and MacOS.

-   Script to generate package after building the application.
